## Story Overview
In a small town shadowed by a dense forest, a man embarks on a chilling search when his wife disappears under mysterious circumstances, last seen with a stranger. Desperate for answers, he ventures into the forest but crashes his car after encountering a ghostly apparition of his wife. Stranded among the dark trees, he searches for clues, only to stumble upon eerie manifestations of his wife and her bloodstained belongings. This triggers his alter personality to take over and erase evidence, leading him to a secluded cabin. Inside, he faces a shocking revelation—his other personality, resembling him, confesses to murdering his wife due to deep-seated resentment that spiraled into violence. Overwhelmed by the truth, the man flees the cabin, only to be arrested by the police, finally facing the grim fate he unknowingly authored.
